# SourceChat
Provides a complete rehaul of the Sven-Coop chat to a Source Engine alike chat including it's features (chat history, selection, scrolling, colors, etc.)

SourceChat is a plugin made for [SvenMod](https://github.com/sw1ft747/svenmod "SvenMod") by [Sw1ft](https://github.com/sw1ft747 "SvenMod") and me.
It would not have been so feaseable to do it without SvenMod, so check it out!

# Installation
You will first need to download and install [SvenMod](https://github.com/sw1ft747/svenmod "SvenMod")
then download a release from [Releases](https://github.com/sw1ft747/svenmod "Releases")
and place all files from the archive in the root folder of the game. 
Next, add the plugin (sourcechat.dll) to the file plugins.txt (see the header Adding plugins in SvenMod's [readme](https://github.com/sw1ft747/svenmod)). .
